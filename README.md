<h1 align="left"><b>Building Web Solutions w/ Passion and Creativity</b></h3>

<blockquote>
<p> 
    I'm a skilled full-stack web developer with just over two years of experience in technologies like <em>JavaScript</em>, <em>React.js</em>, <em>TypeScript</em>, and <em>Node.JS</em>. 
</p>
<p>
    Over these past couple of years, I've had the chance to work on a bunch of different projects, including <b>CRM</b>, <b>e-commerce websites</b>, <b>mobile apps</b>, <b>SDKs</b>, and various <b>developer tools</b>.
</p>
<p>
    What really gets me excited is my involvement in <b>open-source projects</b> and my passion for creating smooth and visually appealing user interfaces that provide a great user experience.
</p>
